# SDET Tech Test

You will need to have completed this tech test with code committed to your branch within 2 days i.e., 2nd Mar EOD. If more time is required or any access-related issues, please inform us **ASAP**. Please note we will only reschedule the interview a maximum of one time.

This test has been scoped to a **SDET level**, so we will be expecting a strong demonstration of technical skills.

## Task 1: UI

Using the site [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) and the Playwright automation tool using JS/TS [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), design test cases and scripts to fully test the functionality of the given feature. The application has different users for being able to stimulate regression defects.

### Feature: Tax Calculation

As a user, I should be able to purchase an item from the store and confirm the tax has been calculated correctly in the total.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- **Scenario**: Tax Calculation for 8%
  - **Given** I am logged in as a user on the Sauce Demo website,
  - **When** I checkout with an item in my cart
  - **Then** I can see tax has been calculated correctly at 8%
  - **And** I can see purchase confirmation text

## Task 2: API

Please ensure you use Playwright's `APIRequestContext` to complete the given test task. Design test cases and scripts to fully test the functionality of the given endpoint.

Using the API [Dog CEO](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random) and the Playwright automation tool using JS/TS [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/),

### Feature: Random Dog Breed Images

Our API should be able to access one of the largest dog databases. As such our random logic for the API should meet the following criteria:

- API is accessible multiple times through GET requests.
- Duplicate images are allowed after 10 requests.

## Task 3: Push code and open a PR on this repo

## Task Completed: Pushed code and opened a PR on this repo 
#**Go To The "tests" directory for the complete code of UI and API**
